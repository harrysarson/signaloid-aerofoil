## Signaloid

### Import empty repo

When I try to import an empty repo (no commits) into signaloid I get the following error:

### Web UI stuck "uploading"

> **NOTE**: this is specific to firefox. Switching to chrome fixed the issue for me.

The WEB UI is here and stays here seemingly for ever.

In the console I see this, not sure if it is an issue or not.

### Odd negative-action button

Clicking this button logs me out from github -- which is slightly odd behaviour.

Clicking this button umounts the storage -- given the button is a happy green button with a tick that seems suprising.
